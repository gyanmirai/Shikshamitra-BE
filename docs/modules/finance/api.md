# Use Finance backend APIs

TL;DR: use this page to find Finance endpoint families and route ownership.
Controller source paths are canonical when a route detail changes.

## Shared request rules

Finance APIs require authenticated access and tenant context through the platform pipeline.
Mutations must enforce backend permissions and audit important financial actions.

## Fees API families

| Family | Controller path | Main routes or base route |
|---|---|---|
| Charges | `Controllers/Finance/Fees/Charges/ChargeController.cs` | `api/app/charges` |
| Concession requests | `Controllers/Finance/Fees/Concessions/ConcessionRequestController.cs` | `api/concession-request`, `api/concession-requests` |
| Fee adjustments | `Controllers/Finance/Fees/Adjustments/FeeAdjustmentController.cs` | `api/fee-adjustments` |
| Fee collection | `Controllers/Finance/Fees/Collections/FeeCollectionController.cs` | Fee collection routes |
| Fee receipts | `Controllers/Finance/Fees/Receipts/FeeReceiptController.cs` | Fee receipt routes |
| Fee refunds | `Controllers/Finance/Fees/Refunds/FeeRefundController.cs` | Fee refund routes |
| Student fee assignment | `Controllers/Finance/Fees/StudentFeeAssignment/StudentFeeStructureController.cs` | Student fee structure routes |
| Fee settings | `Controllers/Finance/Fees/Settings/**` | Fee category, fee head, fee structure, receipt book, concession type, and charge category routes |

Fee-category and fee-head create/update contracts accept `module` as an optional numeric `FeeHeadModule` enum value. Send `null` or omit the property when no module applies. The fee-head module lookup returns numeric `value` fields with user-facing `displayName` labels.

Payment-term requests and responses serialize lifecycle, version, holiday-shifting, demand-generation, and initial-demand enums by name. For example, `demandGenerationRule` uses `OnInstallmentStartDate`, `XDaysBeforeDue`, `OnDueDate`, or `SpecificDate`; numeric enum values are not the canonical wire representation.

Payment-term version history is exposed separately from the full detail snapshot through `GET api/finance/payment-terms/{paymentTermId}/versions`. It accepts the standard `skipCount` and `maxResultCount` paging parameters and returns version number, lifecycle status, change action/reason, creation time, creator id, and hydrated creator name for the history drawer.

Concession Type settings use `GET/POST api/{academicYearId}/concession-types`, `GET/PUT/DELETE api/concession-types/{id}`, `PATCH api/concession-types/{id}/status`, `GET api/concession-types/{id}/versions`, and `GET api/concession-types/document-defaults`. The paged versions endpoint returns the audited action, actor, timestamp, version number, and changed business fields. Administrative lists pass `includeInactive=true`; request creation omits it so only active types are returned. Document contracts use `documentName`, `maxFileSizeBytes`, `acceptedFormats`, and `isRequired`. Active records and used records cannot be deleted; deletion is allowed only after deactivation and while unused. Duplicate normalized names, edits to used document definitions, and missing deactivation reasons return stable business errors. `POST api/concession-request/types/{concessionTypeId}/documents/{documentId}/file` accepts multipart `File` and validates the selected definition's size, extension, MIME type, and file signature before storage.

## Accounts API families

| Family | Controller path |
|---|---|
| Income | `Controllers/Finance/Accounts/Income/IncomeController.cs` |
| Expense | `Controllers/Finance/Accounts/Expense/ExpenseController.cs` |
| Bank accounts | `Controllers/Finance/Accounts/Settings/BankAccountController.cs` |
| Transaction categories | `Controllers/Finance/Accounts/Settings/IncomeCategoryController.cs`, `ExpenseCategoryController.cs` |
| Reconciliation | `Controllers/Finance/Accounts/Reconciliation/ReconciliationController.cs` |

## Reports and audit API families

| Family | Controller path |
|---|---|
| Finance reports | `Controllers/Finance/Reports/FinanceReportController.cs` |
| Finance audit trail | `Controllers/Finance/Audit/FinanceAuditTrailController.cs` |

## Permission families

Use backend constants as the security source of truth.
Known Finance families include `Finance.Fees.Charges.*`, `Finance.Fees.Concession.*`, `Finance.Fees.Adjustment.*`, and related Fees, Accounts, Reports, and Audit permissions.

## Contract rule

Do not create a parallel curated contract tree for Finance.
Add endpoint details here when Finance API docs need more route detail.
Do not restore generated exports under `docs/`.
